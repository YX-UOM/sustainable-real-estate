AI-Powered Sustainability Regulatory Compliance Platform for Real Estate
Overview

An artificial intelligence platform specifically designed for property companies and real estate asset managers to achieve compliance with EU sustainability regulations (SFDR, EU Taxonomy, CSRD) while providing actionable insights for environmental performance improvement.

Problem Statement
The European real estate sector faces unprecedented regulatory complexity with sustainability compliance:

73% of real estate fund managers report insufficient ESG data quality (INREV 2024)

24,000+ pages of EU Taxonomy documentation requiring navigation

40-60 hours/month of manual data input for compliance

6-8 months annual compliance preparation time

£200k-500k estimated annual compliance costs for mid-size property funds


Technical Innovation
Core AI Components

Natural Language Processing (NLP) modules for automated regulatory text interpretation
Computer Vision algorithms for processing utility bills and building documentation
Time-series Forecasting models for energy consumption and carbon emission predictions
Graph Neural Networks for property portfolio relationship mapping
Real-time API Integration framework for regulatory database monitoring

Key Innovation: Semantic Mapping Algorithms
Proprietary algorithms that automatically translate complex EU Taxonomy technical screening criteria into actionable property assessment frameworks, reducing:

Manual interpretation time: weeks → hours
Annual compliance preparation: 6-8 months → 2-4 weeks

Regulatory Framework Coverage

EU Taxonomy Regulation (2020/852) - Real Estate Technical Screening Criteria

SFDR Regulation (2019/2088) - Principal Adverse Impacts for Real Estate

Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) - Double Materiality Requirements

European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD)


Target Market
Primary Customers:

Real estate investment funds (REITs, private equity real estate funds)
Property asset management companies managing £1B+ portfolios
Real estate developers with Article 8/9 fund requirements
Institutional investors requiring SFDR-compliant property investments

Market Size: €400M+ Total Addressable Market (2,000+ European property funds requiring compliance)
Research Foundation
This platform builds upon peer-reviewed academic research in sustainable real estate and PropTech:
